# Kamerdata iOS App

A simple chat application built with SwiftUI that allows users to send messages and receive responses.

## Features

- Chat interface with user and assistant messages
- Real-time message sending
- Loading indicators
- Auto-scroll to latest messages
- Modern SwiftUI design

## Project Structure

- `ChatView.swift` - Main chat interface
- `ChatViewModel.swift` - Business logic and state management
- `Message.swift` - Data model for chat messages
- `KamerdataApp.swift` - App entry point

## Known Issues Fixed

1. **SwiftUI onChange syntax** - Updated to use the new two-parameter closure syntax
2. **API endpoint** - Replaced placeholder API with mock response for demo purposes
3. **AccentColor** - Added proper color definition to prevent build warnings
4. **ProgressView styling** - Added padding for better visual appearance

## Setup Instructions

1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Build and run on iOS Simulator or device
3. The app will work with mock responses

## API Integration

To integrate with a real API:

1. Replace the mock response in `ChatViewModel.swift` with your actual API endpoint
2. Update the `fetchResponse` method to make real network requests
3. Handle authentication and error cases as needed

## Requirements

- iOS 15.0+
- Xcode 14.0+
- Swift 5.7+

## Testing

The project includes unit tests and UI tests. Run tests using Cmd+U in Xcode.
